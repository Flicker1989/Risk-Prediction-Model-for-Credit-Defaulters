# Risk-Prediction-Model-for-Credit-Defaulters
## Introduction
- Credit risk refers to the risk that a current or potential customer (credit defaulter) may not repay back its dues on time. 
- Rising Credit Default Rates remains a major issue with most banks and lending institutions everywhere. 
- It is a real challenge for banks and other lending financial institutions, as they are now more than ever need a Robust Risk Prediction Model to generalize the economic behavior of their current and potential future clients. 
- Model Advantages:  
  • Benefit the lending institutions and customer. 
  • make people more aware of the potential defaulting rate.
  
## Goal
The goal of this project:  
• Building and comparing predictive risk models using advanced classifiers like ensemble methods to resolve problem.    
• Use Logistic Regression as benchmark algorithm and attempt to build a better classifier.
